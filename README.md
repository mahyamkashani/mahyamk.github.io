### Hi there :innocent:, my name is Mahya and I'm a passionate about programming and everything related to Robotics and Planning in robotics. 

Currently improving my knownledge about:

- 🤖 ROS
- 🐍 Python
- 🧠 AI (logic-based inference in decision-making frameworks, or simply utilizing cognitive science in robotics)
- ...etc.

I like to describe myself as someone analytical, self-critical and perfectionist, always trying to improve to be competent on what I do.

I hope you enjoy my content and please do not hesitate to ask me anything! Bye!
